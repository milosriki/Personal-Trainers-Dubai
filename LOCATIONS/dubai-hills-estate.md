## Training in "The Green Heart of Dubai"

Dubai Hills Estate is built for health. Whether you live in **Maple**, **Sidra**, **Mulberry**, or the **Golf Place** mansions, we bring the workout to you.

### 1. Dubai Hills Park Sessions

Take advantage of the longest park in any residential community. We run:

- Early morning interval running.
- Functional circuits on the green spaces.
- Outdoor boxing sessions.

### 2. Villa & Apartment Training

From the cozy layouts of Maple to the grand halls of Parkway Vistas, our trainers adapt to your space. We bring all necessary equipment (mats, weights, bands) so you don't need to clutter your home.
