## How to Calculate Your Calories

### Step 1: Calculate Your BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate)

BMR is the calories your body burns at complete rest.

**Mifflin-St Jeor Formula (Most Accurate):**

**Men:**
```
BMR = (10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) - (5 × age in years) + 5
```

**Women:**
```
BMR = (10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) - (5 × age in years) - 161
```

### Step 2: Calculate Your TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure)

Multiply your BMR by your activity level:

| Activity Level | Multiplier | Description |
|----------------|------------|-------------|
| Sedentary | 1.2 | Desk job, little exercise |
| Lightly Active | 1.375 | Light exercise 1-3 days/week |
| Moderately Active | 1.55 | Moderate exercise 3-5 days/week |
| Very Active | 1.725 | Hard exercise 6-7 days/week |
| Extremely Active | 1.9 | Physical job + hard exercise |

**Your TDEE = BMR × Activity Multiplier**

### Step 3: Adjust for Your Goal

| Goal | Calorie Adjustment |
|------|-------------------|
| **Weight Loss** | TDEE - 500 calories |
| **Aggressive Weight Loss** | TDEE - 750 calories |
| **Maintenance** | TDEE (no change) |
| **Muscle Gain** | TDEE + 250-500 calories |

## Example Calculations

### Example 1: Dubai Executive (Male)

**Profile:**
- Male, 40 years old
- 85 kg, 180 cm
- Desk job, trains 3x/week
- Goal: Lose 10 kg

**Calculation:**
1. BMR = (10 × 85) + (6.25 × 180) - (5 × 40) + 5 = 1,780 calories
2. TDEE = 1,780 × 1.55 = 2,759 calories
3. Weight loss calories = 2,759 - 500 = **2,259 calories/day**

### Example 2: Dubai Professional (Female)

**Profile:**
- Female, 35 years old
- 70 kg, 165 cm
- Office job, trains 2x/week
- Goal: Tone up, lose 5 kg

**Calculation:**
1. BMR = (10 × 70) + (6.25 × 165) - (5 × 35) - 161 = 1,395 calories
2. TDEE = 1,395 × 1.375 = 1,918 calories
3. Weight loss calories = 1,918 - 500 = **1,418 calories/day**

## Macronutrient Calculator

Once you know your calories, split them into macros:

### Recommended Macro Split for Weight Loss

| Macro | Percentage | Per gram |
|-------|------------|----------|
| Protein | 30-35% | 4 calories |
| Carbs | 35-40% | 4 calories |
| Fat | 25-30% | 9 calories |

### Example: 2,000 Calorie Diet

| Macro | Calories | Grams |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Protein (30%) | 600 | 150g |
| Carbs (40%) | 800 | 200g |
| Fat (30%) | 600 | 67g |

### Protein Requirements by Goal

| Goal | Protein per kg bodyweight |
|------|---------------------------|
| Weight Loss | 1.6-2.0g |
| Muscle Building | 1.8-2.2g |
| Maintenance | 1.4-1.6g |
| Athletic Performance | 1.8-2.4g |

## Dubai Lifestyle Adjustments

### Ramadan Adjustments

During Ramadan, eating windows are compressed. Adjust by:
- Eating your full calories between Iftar and Suhoor
- Prioritizing protein at both meals
- Staying hydrated during eating hours
- Reducing training intensity if needed

### Summer Adjustments

Dubai summers require:
- Increased water intake (3-4+ liters)
- Slightly higher sodium intake
- Lighter meals during peak heat
- Morning or evening training only

### Social Event Planning

For brunches and dinners:
- Reduce calories earlier in the day
- Prioritize protein at the event
- Limit alcohol calories
- Return to normal eating the next day

## Common Questions

### How accurate is this calculator?

These formulas are estimates. Individual metabolism varies by:
- Muscle mass
- Genetics
- Hormones
- Sleep quality
- Stress levels

**For best results:** Use this as a starting point, then adjust based on actual results over 2-4 weeks.

### Should I eat back exercise calories?

**General rule:** No. The activity multiplier already accounts for exercise.

**Exception:** If you're doing significantly more exercise than your selected activity level, you may need to eat slightly more.

### Why am I not losing weight at my calculated calories?

Possible reasons:
- Underestimating food intake (most common)
- Overestimating activity level
- Metabolic adaptation
- Water retention
- Building muscle while losing fat

**Solution:** Track food accurately for 2 weeks, then adjust calories down by 100-200 if no progress.

### Is 1,200 calories safe?

**Generally no.** Very low calorie diets:
- Cause muscle loss
- Slow metabolism
- Are unsustainable
- Lead to nutrient deficiencies

**Minimum recommendations:**
- Women: 1,200-1,400 calories
- Men: 1,500-1,800 calories

If your calculated deficit puts you below these numbers, increase activity instead of cutting more calories.
