## Video Testimonials

### Maurice - Executive, Lost 8-10 kg, Got Six-Pack

**Watch:** [YouTube](https://youtu.be/BtqIQncAUOc) | [Website](https://www.personaltrainersdubai.com/testimonials)

> "I was doing some stuff on my own - a little bit of TRX, riding my bike. I was just trying to maintain a basic level of fitness. I didn't really have any major objectives. Then I injured my wrist, tore the TFCC ligament. I was in a cast for six weeks.
>
> I reached out to Milos and said, can you help me with a workout that will keep me in shape without stressing my wrist? He started coming over, used straps and dumbbells. We did it here at home.
>
> We initially focused on high intensity cardio, getting the body focused on diet. Then we went into the gym, started focusing on muscle mass. Stefan challenged me to set objectives. I said, I want a six pack by the summer.
>
> **I lost about 8-10 kilos over three to four months.**
>
> There's a lot of mediocre trainers out there, people that don't know their stuff. One of the things that gave me confidence starting to work with Milos was his pedigree - he's a champion athlete. He knew his stuff. I knew he was not an average trainer."

**Result:** Lost 8-10 kg in 3-4 months, achieved six-pack abs

### Dr. Rida - Mom of Two, Lost 18 kg Postpartum

**Watch:** [Website Testimonial](https://www.personaltrainersdubai.com/testimonials)

> "I am Dr. Rida, 33 years old and mom of two - a toddler and an infant. I started working with Natasha after my second baby when I was three months postpartum.
>
> **When I started, I was around 75 kg. My current weight is 57 kg.**
>
> My energy levels were really low. I used to get tired just by carrying my little one. I was not feeling like my own self. I wanted to go back to my pre-pregnancy energy levels. I wanted to bounce back.
>
> I still remember on our initial assessment, I was about to faint. My energy levels were so bad and I had zero stamina. But right now my sleep has improved, my energy levels have improved, I'm able to play with my toddler, I'm able to carry my infant without feeling fatigued.
>
> I didn't work out before this, like in my entire life. For me, starting with Natasha was like starting from scratch. She's so kind, a beautiful soul inside and out. She never judged me. She helped me through each tiny step.
>
> **Natasha was my blessing in disguise. I would highly, highly recommend her.**"

**Result:** Lost 18 kg (75 kg → 57 kg), improved energy, better sleep
