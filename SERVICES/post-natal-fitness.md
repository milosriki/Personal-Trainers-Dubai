## Your Body Has Done Something Amazing. Now let's heal.

Returning to fitness after childbirth requires patience, knowledge, and care. “Bouncing back” isn't the goal—**rebuilding stronger** is.

### 1. Diastasis Recti & Core Repair

Many standard "ab workouts" can actively harm post-natal recovery. Our specialists are trained to:

- Assess abdominal separation (Diastasis Recti).
- Prescribe deep core engagement exercises (TVA focus).
- Avoid intra-abdominal pressure that worsens the "pooch".

### 2. Pelvic Floor Health

We work in conjunction with your physiotherapist to ensure your pelvic floor is strengthening correctly, preventing long-term issues.

### 3. Baby-Friendly Sessions

No childcare? No problem.

- Train while baby naps.
- Incorporate the stroller into outdoor walks/lunges.
- We come to you, so you don't need to pack a diaper bag to go to the gym.

## Why Specialist Training Matters

General trainers often rush high-impact exercises (jumping, crunches) too soon. Our protocol is:

1.  **Reconnect:** Breath and core connection (Weeks 0-6 postpartum - cleared by doctor).
2.  **Stability:** Pelvic alignment and glute strength.
3.  **Strength:** Gradual return to lifting and conditioning.
