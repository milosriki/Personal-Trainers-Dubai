## Our Story

**PTD Fitness** was founded with a simple mission: make world-class personal training accessible to busy professionals in Dubai and Abu Dhabi.

We recognized that the traditional gym model doesn't work for everyone. Long commutes, crowded facilities, and inflexible schedules prevent many people from achieving their fitness goals. Our solution: bring the trainer, equipment, and expertise directly to you.

Since 2015, we've grown from a single trainer to Dubai's leading personal training at your location service, with a team of Master's degree certified coaches serving clients across 40+ areas.
