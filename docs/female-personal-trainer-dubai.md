## Women's Training Programs

PTD Fitness offers specialized programs designed specifically for women's needs and goals.

### Postpartum Recovery

Getting back in shape after pregnancy requires specialized knowledge. PTD Fitness trainers understand diastasis recti, pelvic floor recovery, and the unique challenges new mothers face.

**Dr. Rida's Story — Lost 18 kg Postpartum:**
> "I am Dr. Rida, 33 years old and mom of two - a toddler and an infant. I started working with Natasha after my second baby when I was three months postpartum. When I started, I was around 75 kg. My current weight is 57 kg. I still remember on our initial assessment, I was about to faint. My energy levels were so bad. But right now my sleep has improved, my energy levels have improved, I'm able to play with my toddler, I'm able to carry my infant without feeling fatigued. Natasha was my blessing in disguise."

### Weight Loss for Women

Women's bodies respond differently to exercise and nutrition than men's. PTD Fitness female trainers design programs that account for hormonal fluctuations, metabolism differences, and women's specific body composition goals.

**Malika's Story — Lost 25 kg, Off Diabetic Medicine:**
> "She lost 25 kg and balanced her blood pressure and no longer needs diabetic medicine."

### Strength and Toning

Building lean muscle helps women increase metabolism, improve bone density, and create the toned physique many desire. PTD Fitness trainers use progressive resistance training tailored to each client's goals.

**Priya's Story — Lost 20 kg at Age 54:**
> "I feel lighter, I feel more energetic, and at 54 years of age, I feel strong and fast."

### Pre-Natal Fitness

Staying active during pregnancy supports both mother and baby. PTD Fitness trainers are certified in pre-natal exercise and design safe, effective programs for each trimester.
