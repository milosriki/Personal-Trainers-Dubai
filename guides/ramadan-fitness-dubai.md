## 🌙 Ramadan is NOT a Reason to Stop Training

Every year in Dubai, gyms become ghost towns until 9 PM, then chaotic zoos until 2 AM. Most people gain fat from fried Iftar foods and lose muscle from inactivity. **Don't be most people.**

### The "Golden Hour" Strategy

The single best time to train during Ramadan in Dubai:

1.  **Before Suhoor (4:00 AM):** High energy, max hydration.
2.  **Pre-Iftar (1 Hour Before):** Fat burning zone (low intensity cardio).
3.  **Post-Taraweeh:** The "Pump" session after re-feeding.

### PTD's "Villas Over Malls" Approach

Avoid the nightmare of driving to Mall of the Emirates or Dubai Mall gyms during Ramadan nights. The traffic is unbearable.

- **We come to you.**
- Train at 5 PM (Pre-Iftar) in your home AC.
- Shower and be ready for Iftar immediately.
