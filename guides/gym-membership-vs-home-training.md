## 🚫 The "Lease" vs. The Service

When you sign up for a mega-gym in Dubai, what are you buying?

- You are **renting access** to machines.
- You are **not** buying results.
- You are **not** buying accountability.

**The Business Model:**
Gyms oversell their capacity by 300%. If everyone showed up, you wouldn't fit in the door. They _bank_ on you getting busy, getting stuck in traffic on Sheikh Zayed Road, and staying home.

### The "Hidden" Costs of a Gym Membership

1.  **Membership:** 400-800 AED/month.
2.  **Petrol/Salik:** 200 AED/month driving there.
3.  **Time:** 6 hours/month commuting (worth 1000+ AED of your time).
4.  **Privacy:** Zero. Influencers filming tripods in your face.

## 📉 Stop "Renting" Fitness. Start Owning It.

If you have had a gym membership for 6 months and look the same... it's not the gym's fault. It's the model's fault.

**Change the variable.**
