### Weight Loss Transformations

**Edwin — Lost 22 kg in 40 Sessions**

**Firas — Lost 20 kg in 2 Months**

**Alessandro (Google Executive) — Lost 30 kg in 6 Months**

> "We lost 30 kilos of weight, a lot of fat, and I'm more agile, faster, happier, healthier."

### Executive Transformations

**Maurice (CEO) — Lost 8-10 kg, Achieved Six-Pack**

> "There's a lot of mediocre trainers out there, people that don't know their stuff. One of the things that gave me confidence starting to work with Milos was his pedigree - he's a champion athlete. He knew his stuff. I knew he was not an average trainer. I lost about 8-10 kilos over three to four months."

**Rashan (Ford Executive) — Lost 15 kg with Super Busy Schedule**

> "At 46 with a super busy schedule, I'm in the best shape of my life. Thank you, Milos."

**Marwan (Age 55) — Lost 10 kg in 2.5 Months**

### Women's Transformations

**Dr. Rida (Mom of Two) — Lost 18 kg Postpartum**

> "When I started, I was around 75 kg. My current weight is 57 kg. I still remember on our initial assessment, I was about to faint. My energy levels were so bad. But right now my sleep has improved, my energy levels have improved. Natasha was my blessing in disguise."

**Malika — Lost 25 kg, Off Diabetic Medicine**
